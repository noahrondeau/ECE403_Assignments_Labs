# ECE403: Optimization for Machine Learning
## Labs and Assignments

This repository stored my personal solutions to the course assignments and labs offered in during the course ECE403 at the University of Victoria.

They implement various well-known optimization and ML algorithms on common datasets. The implementations are in Matlab. The assignments and labs are listed here for convenience:

**Assignments:**
1. Various code snippets to compute matrix decompositions

**Labs:**
1. Classification of the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Principle Component Analysis

## Disclaimer:
This code is here because I'm proud of it and I want to show my achievements.Pretty much all the code I write ends up on Github, regardless of the context it was written in. With that in mind, a few disclaimers are in order:

I did not create the assignment questions or the lab problems, and I make no representations to that effect.
I did not create the datasets nor organize them, they are freely available datasets from academic sources online.
The solutions presented here are my own work, and are not to be copied or redistributed.
